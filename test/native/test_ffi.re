  /* A pretty simple promise loop. This is just a function that takes a promise,
     and calls .flatMap on it. The callback passed to .flatMap calls the loop
     recursively, passing another promise to the next iteration. The interesting
     part is not the argument promise, but the result promise returned by each
     iteration.

     If Promise is implemented naively, the iteration will result in a big
     chain of promises hanging in memory: a memory leak. Here is how:

     - At the first iteration, .flatMap creates an outer pending promise p0, and
       returns it immediately to the rest of the code.
     - Later, the callback passed to .flatMap runs. It again calls .flatMap,
       creating another pending promise p1. The callback then returns p1. This
       means that resolving p1 should resolve p0, so a naive implementation
       will store a reference in p1 to p0.
     - Later, the callback passed to p1's .flatMap runs, doing the same thing:
       creating another pending promise p2, pointing to p1.
     - By iteration N, there is a chain of N pending promises set up, such that
       resolving the inner-most promise in the chain, created by the last
       .flatMap, will resolve the outer-most promise p0, created by the first
       .flatMap. This is the memory leak. */

     to merge the inner promise returned to flatMap into flatMap's outer promise.
     After that, all operations on the inner promise reference are actually
     performed on the outer promise.

     This carries the danger that a tower of these merged promises can build
     up. If a pending promise is repeatedly returned to flatMap, it will
     gradually become the head of a growing chain of forwarding promises, that
     point to the outer promise created in the last call to flatMap.

     To avoid this, the implementation has to perform union-find: each time it
     traverses a chain of merged promises, it has to set the head promise to
     point directly to the final outer promise, cutting out all intermediate
     merged promises. Then, any of these merged promises that aren't being
     referenced by the user program can be garbage-collected. */
